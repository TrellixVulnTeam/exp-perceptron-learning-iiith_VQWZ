- For the given perceptron network, observe that the intial assignment of weights is completely random.
- Observe the number of iterations required for the weights to converge, i.e. to achieve classification for the given case.
- Repeat the experiment for different number of samples per class and observe if there exists a relation between the number of samples per class and iteration steps required to converge .
